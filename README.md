We present \pkg{GAMA}, a Genetic Approach to MAximize a clustering criteria --- a \proglang{R} package for evolutionary hard partitional clustering, by using guided operators (those guided by some kind of information about the quality of individual clusters), for a fixed \textit{a priori} known number of partitions, encoded as real-valued centroid based partitions.
